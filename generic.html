							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic-13.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My name is Yesica Magnoli, I am a chemical engineer and I am 28 years old. I worked for the last 3 years as a quality engineer in a multinational pretroleum service company, and I have recently decided to take a few deeper steps in my career by studing Data Science.</p>
							<p>In case you may wonder why, please let me first of all introduce you into the Chemical engineering world.</p>
							<p>Chemical engineering is an interdisciplinary field that allows you to move into a wide range of industries (not to say all) such as petroleum, chemical synthesis & pharmaceuticals, energy, bio- & medical-materials, engineering economics, environment in all aspects, just to mention some big ones.
								Then you can also opt for researching, instrumentation and simulation, research & development, facility design, plant operations & optimization, safety & health, sales, and management.</p>
							<p>With all of that being said, having a strength in data science is a major plus for all of those â€” and any others you can think of. I am passionate about solving-problems and learning, that is why I chose Chemical Engineering as my formal career and now, also discovered the world of data science and its power as a tool to complement my engineer professional toolbox. </p>	
							<p>Both together would open a number of interesting doors to discover.</p>
